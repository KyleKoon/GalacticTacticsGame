# GalacticTacticsGame
This program creates the Galactic Tactics game. In this game, the user left-clicks on a ship during their turn to select it. After
selection, the player can either right-click or press the left or right arrow key. A right-click will cause the selected ship to move one tile
forward in the direction that it is facing. Pressing the right arrow key will rotate the selected ship 90 degrees clockwise. Pressing the left arrow
key will rotate the selected ship 90 degrees counterclockwise. On each turn, a player gets to do two actions. Moving and changing heading count as two
separate actions.
